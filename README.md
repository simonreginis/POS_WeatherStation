# POS_WeatherStation

Aim of the project is to create a wireless weather station composed of two inependent units. Weather measurements contain pressure, temperature and humidity. First unit is the base station, which measures those three values and displays them on integral LCD screen. Second unit also measures those three metrics and sends them to the main unit via radio. Project is based on Arduino Nano boards, BME-280 sensor, FS100A radio unit and a simple LCD screen.
